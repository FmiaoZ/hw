This means the variables may have strong local effects that are statistically significant, but collectively the model doesn’t capture all the underlying complexities in the data.\n",

    "\n",
    "We compared two regression models, `model6_fit` and `model7_fit`, focusing on multicollinearity, complexity, performance, and interpretability. Both models showed mild multicollinearity, which isn't a major issue. While `model7_fit` is more complex and offers better out-of-sample performance, it includes weaker coefficient evidence and intricate interaction terms that reduce interpretability. In contrast, `model6_fit` is simpler, more interpretable, and has stronger predictor support, making it a more reliable and understandable choice despite slightly lower performance. Overall, favoring the simpler `model6_fit` is recommended for its balance of performance, clarity, and robustness."
